# Lofi study music is one of the largest, most prominent music genres to emerge online in the past decade. Between streams of the “Lofi Girl” and countless “chill beats” playlists, lofi music is now synonymous with late-night study sessions and the student experience. I wanted to investigate the dynamics of this community. Are students documenting their academic stresses, nostalgia, or motivation? Is the comment section that is associated with lofi music just a uniquely supportive one? In order to answer this question, I scraped several lists of lofi study music from YouTube and ran those comments through various analyses, using several techniques explored in class (APIs, JSON, Pandas, sentiment analysis, and TF-IDF).
